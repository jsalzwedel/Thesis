%\subsubsection{$\Lambda$ reconstruction}
\label{sec:Recon}

$\Lambda$ are neutral particles, and as such we do not directly detect them.  
Instead, $\Lambda$ are topologically reconstructed by looking for the daughter tracks that they decay into.  
The general term for particles reconstructed this way (including $\bar{\Lambda}$ and $K^0_\mathrm{s}$) is V0.

For each event, the list of AliAODv0 objects is used as an initial list of V0 candidates.  
Only AliAODv0 objects with (AliAODv0::GetOnFlyStatus() == false) are used.  
These are V0s constructed offline by the AliV0Vertexer using combined TPC-ITS tracking (or TPC-only if the ITS is inactive).  
After obtaining a list of V0 candidates, the following cuts were applied for each V0's daughter tracks.

\begin{itemize}
\item The V0 was rejected if (AliAODv0::GetNDaughters() $> 2$), and the daughters are required to have different charges.
\item The daughter tracks were required to have hits on at least 80 pad rows of the TPC.
\item The daughter protons and antiprotons were required to have $p_{\rm T} > 0.5$ GeV/$c$, and the daughter pions required $p_{\rm T} \geq 0.16$ GeV/$c$. 
The difference between proton and antiproton $p_{\rm T}$ cuts arises from a need to minimize contaminations from material protons. 
All daughters were required to be in the range $|\eta| < 0.8$.
\item The TPC was used for PID purposes.  
A daughter was considered a proton and/or pion if the PID resolution task returned a respective $\mathrm{d}E/\mathrm{d}x$ NSigma value less than 3 for it.
\item Daughter tracks were required to have a TOF PID NSigma value less than 4 if the TOF signal was available.
\item The two daughters are required to have a AliAODv0::DcaV0Daughters() $< 0.4$ (the vertexer computes this DCA using resolution weighting, so the units here should probably be called "effective cm").
\item The proton daughter was required to have a DCA to the primary vertex $> 0.1$ cm.
\item The pion daughter was required to have a DCA to the primary vertex $> 0.3$ cm.
\end{itemize}

Each V0 is then subjected to the following cuts:
\begin{itemize}
\item The V0 is required to have $|\eta| < 0.8$.
\item The V0 is required to have a proper decay length less than 60 cm.
\item The cosine of the pointing angle must be greater than 0.9993.
\item The DCA of the V0 to the primary vertex must be less than 0.5 cm.
\item For a $\Lambda$ was required to have a proton daughter and a $\pi^-$ daughter (as determined using the above PID cuts).  
For a $\bar{\Lambda}$, an antiproton and $\pi^+$ daughter were required.
\item For both $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$, the reconstructed invariant mass was required to fall within $\abs{m_\mathrm{inv}-m_\mathrm{PDG}} < 3.8$ MeV.  
Note that this cut value was determined by inspection of the $p_\mathrm{T}$-integrated invariant mass peak.  
Future investigation of $p_\mathrm{T}$-dependent invariant mass peak and subsequently enforcing a $p_\mathrm{T}$-dependent cut could lead to better background reduction.  
Also, close inspection of Figure \ref{fig:BothInvMass} shows that the peak multiplicity occurs at a mass slightly higher (several tenths of an MeV) than the PDG mass value.  
As such, it may be better to use an invariant mass window centered around the reconstructed peak value, rather than the PDG mass.  
This will also be investigated in the future.
\end{itemize}

The optimal cut values were determined by comparing distributions of reconstructed $\Lambda$ in Monte Carlo HIJING events with simulated detector effects.  
The data set (LHC12a17a\_fix) included injected strange signals (extra $\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, $\Xi$, and $\Omega$ in each event).  
In this analysis, we have estimated the reconstruction efficiency of primary and secondary $\Lambda$ reconstruction efficiency in an effort to account for feeddown effects (see Section \ref{sec:ReconstructionEff}).
The added particles sample a $p_\mathrm{T}$ range that allows for easy detector reconstruction, which skews those efficiency estimates.
Therefore, we have performed our MC analyses with  the injected signals removed.  A primary particle (AliAODMCParticle) was considered injected if it had AliAODMCParticle::GetLabel() greater than AliGenHijingEventHeader::NProduced()$-1$. 
Likewise, a secondary particle (e.g.\ $\Lambda$ resulting from decay of a $\Sigma$ baryon) was considered injected if it's mother particle had AliAODMCParticle::GetLabel() greater than AliGenHijingEventHeader::NProduced()$-1$.  

$\Lambda$ were reconstructed and their corresponding AliAODMCParticle objects were consulted in order to classify the $\Lambda$ into different categories: Real, primary $\Lambda$; secondary $\Lambda$ coming from decays of $\Sigma$ (or $\Sigma$ excited states); secondary $\Lambda$ coming from decays of $\Xi$, $\Omega$, and other sources; fake $\Lambda$; and $K^0_\mathrm{s}$ that have been misidentified as $\Lambda$.  
For each cut parameter (e.g.\ cosine of pointing angle), a plot was made showing the distributions of V0 candidates of the various types.  
These plots contain only the parameter distributions of candidates that pass all the other cuts.  Figures \ref{fig:LambdaCutDists1} and \ref{fig:LambdaCutDists2} show these distributions for the different $\Lambda$ types.  
Figures \ref{fig:AntiLambdaCutDists1} and \ref{fig:AntiLambdaCutDists2} show the equivalent results for $\bar{\Lambda}$.

\end{figure}

For the construction of Figures \ref{fig:LambdaCutDists1},\ref{fig:LambdaCutDists2},\ref{fig:AntiLambdaCutDists1}, and \ref{fig:AntiLambdaCutDists2}, each $\Lambda$ type was preselected using AliAODMCParticle information, and only V0 candidates of that type were reconstructed in that analysis run. 
This was done for ease of histogramming the distributions.  
Roughly equal numbers events were analyzed for each run type, with the exception of the analysis of the primary $\Lambda$.  That analysis run utilized only about half the data set.  
Therefore, the primary $\Lambda$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$) distributions in Figures \ref{fig:LambdaCutDists1},\ref{fig:LambdaCutDists2},\ref{fig:AntiLambdaCutDists1}, and \ref{fig:AntiLambdaCutDists2} have been scaled by a factor of 2 to compensate.

In these figures, both the shape and magnitude of each distribution is relevant for determining the cuts. 
For each cut type, a cut value was selected such that a looser cut would differentially accept more fake or secondary $\Lambda$ than primary $\Lambda$. 
Ideally, these cuts would be selected to reduce the inclusion of all types of secondary $\Lambda$.  
However, it can be seen from the distributions that $\Lambda$ that come from $\Sigma$ decay display virtually the same cut parameter distribution shapes as primary $\Lambda$.  
Only the magnitude of the $\Sigma$ curves differ from the primary $\Lambda$ curves.  
This is due to the short decay length of the $\Sigma$ decay: $c\tau \approx 20$ pm for $\Sigma^0$ , and $c\tau \approx 6$ fm for $\Sigma$(1385). 
As a result, secondary $\Lambda$ from $\Sigma$ look identical to primary $\Lambda$ from the perspective of topological cuts, and they cannot be selectively removed from the analysis.

The systematic errors associated with these cut choices are discussed in Section \ref{sec:SystematicsReconstruction}. 
Further discussion of the reconstruction efficiency of the different $\Lambda$ types can be found in Section \ref{sec:ReconstructionEff}.

The reconstructed invariant mass distribution for $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ can be seen in Figures \ref{fig:LamInvMass} and \ref{fig:ALamInvMass}. 
An approximation of the signal purity was estimated using a ratio of real and background (falsely reconstructed) counts.  
The background was estimated using a fourth order polynomial.  
The number of real $\Lambda$ was then estimated by counting the bin content and subtracting the background. 
The signal quality was found to be $real/(real + background) \approx 0.95$.  $\bar{\Lambda}$ were found to have approximately the purity.  
From inspection of Figures \ref{fig:LamInvMass} and \ref{fig:ALamInvMass}, the $\bar{\Lambda}/\Lambda$ ratio is estimated to be about 93\%.

\subsubsection{Decay radius (XY) cut}
The V0 finder includes a default decay radius cut of 0.9 cm, which removes V0s with a radial decay length less than that value.  
This helps mitigate issues such as high track density which can complicate reconstruction.  
This analysis only uses the default cut, though it is possible that a tighter cut could yield improved $\Lambda$ purity without severely impacting the available statistics.  
Changes in this cut are expected to have only small effects on the correlation functions themselves.  
As will be described later in this note, fits of correlation functions have a $\lambda$ parameter which accounts for the pair-purity (roughly the square of the single particle purity).  
In any case, a few percent increase in purity should not drastically impact the shape of the correlation functions.
Studies of this cut may improve V0 selection for future analyses.

\subsubsection{Shared daughter cut}

Occasionally two or more V0s are reconstructed that both claim the same daughter track.  
However, a given track can only be the daughter of, at most, one V0.  
Therefore, if several reconstructed V0s all lay claim to the same daughter, at most only one of them can be a true V0.  
It was decided to employ a cut that would compare characteristics of the different V0s to determine which of them was most likely to be the true parent particle.  
After the best V0 was found, the competing V0s were removed from the list of V0 particles and not used during same- or mixed-event pair construction.

A study was done using MC event truths to determine which cut would be most successful at removing fraudulent V0s.  
The following characteristics were examined as candidates for the cut criterion:

\begin{itemize}
\item Closeness of invariant mass to the PDG mass value.
\item DCA of the daughter particles to each other.
\item Cosine of the pointing angle.
\item DCA of the V0 to the primary vertex.
\end{itemize}

The process of culling V0s with shared-daughters was done by looping through V0s on an event-by-event basis after the V0 reconstruction process was completed.  
For each V0 in the list of successfully reconstructed V0s (i.e. V0s that passed all cuts), the V0 was compared with each other V0 in the event to determine if they shared a daughter.  
Two V0s "share" a daughter if both V0s have a charged daughter track with the same track ID.  
When two V0s were found that shared a daughter, their values of the cut criterion were compared.  
The daughter with the stricter value (e.g.\ smaller DCA to primary vertex) was adjudged to be the better V0 candidate, and the other V0 was flagged as "bad" for failing the shared-daughter cut.  
V0s that failed the shared-daughter cut were not used in any pair construction (same event or mixed event).

However, it is possible for a V0 to share a daughter or daughters with two different V0s. 
In the aforementioned scheme, it is therefore possible for an excessive number of V0s to fail the shared daughter cut (excessive in that some of those failed V0s only shared a daughter with another failed V0).  
To avoid throwing away too many V0s, a second loop was added to shared-daughter cut method to un-flag V0s that no longer share a daughter with any "good" V0. 
Example: V0s "A" and "B" both share a daughter, and V0s "A" and "C" share a different daughter.  "A" has a better DCA than "B", so "B" is flagged as bad.  
Then "C" is found to have a better DCA than "A", so "A" is flagged as bad.  
Finally, "B" is re-flagged as good because it no longer shares a daughter with any other good V0.

This method was adapted to run iteratively over the list of V0s candidates until a stable list of non-sharing V0s was found.  
Then the MC truths of each V0 (those marked "good" and those marked "bad") were examined.  
With this information, it is possible to calculate the percentages of true V0s and fake V0s that are removed via this process.  
This analysis was run several times, each time using a different comparison criterion from the list above.

Based on the MC truth study, keeping the V0 with the closest DCA to the primary vertex was found to successfully keep 87\% of true V0s that had shared daughters.  
In comparison, the cosine of pointing angle criteria was also successful 87\% of the time (cos$(\Theta_\mathrm{p})$ and DCA to primary vertex are strongly correlated), the DCA of daughters to each other criteria was successful 81\% of the time, and the absolute value of mass difference criteria was successful 79\% of the time.
Based on these results, the DCA to primary vertex criteria was selected to used for the shared-daughter cut before correlation function construction.

%On average there were two competing particles per every ... events in the MC study.  When applied to analysis of the LHC11h data, the rate was two per ....

One of the benefits of this cut is that it helps remove a splitting-like effect (see Section \ref{sec:PairWiseCuts} for more on splitting), wherein a true V0 shares each of its daughters with two separate fake V0s.  
By the nature of the reconstruction cuts, all three of the V0s will be close in momentum space.  
Therefore a pair constructed from the two fake V0s will contaminate the low relative-momentum region of the correlation function.  
That pair of fake V0s does not share any daughters with each other, so it is not kept out of the correlation function by simple daughter ID checks.  
But the iterative daughter-sharing cut described above is capable removing this fraudulent pair, since either of the fake V0s is likely to be removed for sharing a daughter with the true V0.

\subsubsection{Relative momentum}
\label{sec:RelativeMomentum}

This analysis studies two-particle correlations as a function of the one-dimensional relative momentum $k^*$.
To be precise, for a pair of particles with four-momenta $p_1$ and $p_2$, $k^*$ is the momentum of one the particles in the pair's center of mass frame.
It is defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kstar}
k^*= \sqrt{-k^\mu k_\mu},
\end{equation}
where $k^\mu$ is half of the four-vector relative momentum
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kmu}
k^\mu = \frac{p_1^\mu - p_2^\mu}{2} -\frac{(p_1 - p_2)\cdot P}{2P^2}P^\mu,
\end{equation}
$P$ is the four-vector momentum sum.

The literature is inconsistent when it comes to the notation for relative momentum.
In some cases, $k^*$ refers both to the invariant quantity and to the four-vector.
In this thesis, we will try to consistently use $k^*$ to designate the invariant quantity, and use $k^\mu$ when speaking of four-momenta.
In some papers, $q$ or $q_{\mathrm{inv}}$ is used to represent the relative momentum.
Though we won't use $q$ in this analysis, for reference
$q^\mu = 2k^\mu$, and $q_{\mathrm{inv}} = 2 k^*$.


\subsubsection{Correlation function construction}
\label{sec:CFconstruct}

The correlation function is constructed as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CFDefinition}
C(k^*) = \frac{A(k^*)}{B(k^*)},
\end{equation}
where $A(k^*)$ is the two-particle distribution of the given event and $B(k^*)$ is the distribution of a reference event.  
In practice, the signal event histogram $A(k^*)$ is constructed by binning the $k^*$ value of each pair of particles in a single event, and repeating this for each event.  
The reference or background histogram is constructed by binning $k^*$ for pairs of particles taken from different events.  
The correlation function therefore is the ratio of the two-particle phase-space with correlated effects coming from interactions (the numerator) to the two-particle phase-space without correlated effects (the denominator).
Because the denominator pairs are uncorrelated, their two-particle phase space is essentially a convolution of two single-particle phase spaces.
Of course, the numerator pairs are also affected by the single-particle phase spaces.
We assume that the physics of the numerator pairs can be factorized to separate out the correlated physics effects and the single-particle phase space effects.
Thus, dividing by the background pair distribution leaves us with just the correlated physics effects, i.e.\ the correlation function. See Section \ref{sec:KooninPratt} for more details.

In order for the phase-space effects to divide out, it is of course necessary for the mixed events to resemble the true events.
For example, a mixed event where half the particles come from a central collision and half the particles come from a very peripheral collision would have a very different two-particle phase space than a central collision would.
Care is therefore taken to ensure that pairs are mixed from events with similar characteristics. 
Mixed events are required to have approximately the same centrality (bin width of 5\%) and primary vertex z-position (2 cm bin width).  
There are approximately five mixed events for each real event.  
When constructing pairs of V0s from the same event, the V0s are not allowed to share a daughter with the same track ID. 
The correlation functions are normalized to unity in the $ 0.3 < k^* < 0.5$ GeV/c range.

\subsubsection{Pair-wise cuts}
\label{sec:PairWiseCuts}

Femtoscopic studies look at the relative momentum of particles, and often the most interesting physics lies at very low relative momentum (around 0.1 GeV/c and lower).  
As a result, two-track reconstruction effects such as track splitting and track merging, both of which occur for tracks with similar momenta and trajectories, can have a large effect on the measured results.  
Track splitting means that the track left by a single charged particle is reconstructed as two separate tracks. 
A track splitting-like effect can also occur from cutting out tracks with too many shared TPC clusters.
Track merging occurs when the tracks of two separate particles are reconstructed as a single track.  
For V0s, splitting/merging occurs on the level of the daughter tracks, and it affects the reconstruction of the parent V0s.
However, one must be somewhat cautious here, since there can be physics effects that lead to a suppression or enhancement of tracks that are close together.
In particular, small track separation correlates somewhat with small relative momentum, so effects that suppress (enhance) low-$k^*$ pairs may also lead to some suppression (enhancement) of low-average separation pairs.  

In this analysis, two-track reconstruction effects are combated via a cut on the average separation of daughter tracks from different $\Lambda/\bar{\Lambda}$.  
The average separation distance of two daughter tracks are computed at nine different radii of the TPC.  
The track positions are measured via AliExternalTrackParam::GetXYZatR() at the following radii: 85, 105, 125, 145, 165, 185, 205, 225, and 245 cm.  
Pairs of daugther tracks are made from one daughter from the first V0 and one daughter from the second V0. Pairs are made for all daughter combinations, and each type of pair is tracked separately.
For each pair of daughter tracks, their separation is computed at each of those radii, and their average separation is taken as the mean value. If a track does not have a value at a particular radius (e.g.\ a low $p_T$ track with a small radius of curvature), that position is excluded from the calculation of the mean.
Same- and mixed-event pairs are binned according to this separation distance.  
To obtain an estimate of the merging/splitting effects both distributions are then scaled by the number of pairs at high average separation distance (10+ cm), and a correlation function (same event pairs/ mixed event pairs) is created. 

To ensure that average separation distributions of mixed-event pairs are comparable to the same-event distributions, it is necessary to perform a shifting of the primary vertex for mixed events.  
Doing so allows the track separations to be calculated as though both events had the same primary vertex.  
Without this correction, the mixed-event distributions are biased by differences in the primary vertex location.  
One could imagine an extreme example of this if one used a 20 cm wide z-vertex bin.  
In that case, tracks from different events could be shifted relative to each other by as much as 20 cm. 

The average separation correlation functions for various V0 daughter combinations are available in Figure \ref{fig:AverageSeparationAllPairs}.  
We see that all like-sign pair combinations, as well as proton-antiproton, show a dip at low average separation.  
This dip tells us that there is a depletion of tracks that are close together. 
This depletion may come from track merging or from effects similar to track merging, such as the rejection of tracks that have too many shared TPC clusters.
For these pairs of tracks, we implement cuts at average separation value where the correlation function looks to reach unity.
These cuts are applied uniformly to same-event and mixed-event pairs.
pp and $\bar{\mathrm{p}}\bar{\mathrm{p}}$ pairs are cut if their separation lies below 12 cm, while $\pi^-\pi^-$, $\pi+\pi^+$, p$\pi^+$, $\bar{\mathrm{p}}\pi^-$ and p$\bar{\mathrm{p}}$ are cut below 10 cm.

For the other opposite-sign pairs, the splitting/merging picture is less clear, in great part due to the low statistics at low average separation.
First and foremost, this tells us that there is a very low phase space for finding oppositely charged particles. 
That should not be a surprise, as the ambient magnetic field accelerates them in opposite directions.
As it is not clear whether there exists splitting or merging from these pairs, a conservatively large average separation cut has been implemented. p$\pi^-$ and $\bar{\mathrm{p}}\pi^+$ are cut at 15 cm, and $\pi^-\pi^+$ are cut at 25 cm.

One alternative/complement to using an average separation cut would be to enforce a relative decay length cut, where V0s are not paired with each other if their difference between their lab frame decay length values is less than some cut value (e.g.\ a few cm).  
One advantage of this cut is that the decay lengths of the various particles should be independent of physics effects - i.e. independent of any quantum interference or final state interaction that might occur between the particles.  
Meanwhile, the decay length cut may minimize daughter splitting effects, as well as some merging of low- and mid-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ daughters.  
High-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ daughters may still be affected by merging, since higher-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ particles have straighter trajectories in the TPC.  
A study of relative decay length has not been performed here, but it may prove useful to combat splitting/merging effects in future V0 analyses.

The correlation function reveals merging-like effects for all same-sign pairs and also for p$\bar{\mathrm{p}}$. To remove splitting/merging effects, V0 pairs are cut if  their daughters' average separation is below the indicated red line. Conservatively large cuts have been implemented for oppositely-charged pairs.}

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Momentum resolution correction}
\label{sec:MomentumResCorrectionCF}

There is an inherent resolution to V0 momenta that depends on the resolution of the reconstructed daughter tracks.  
Because of this limit of precision, there is also an associated resolution to the relative momentum of two V0s.
This causes the reconstructed relative momentum of the pair to differ from the true momentum of the pair, and it therefore introduces subtle changes to the measured correlation functions which must be accounted for.

Tradionally, the momentum resolution correction is performed on the experimental data to unsmear it into a form that should resemble the theoretical predictions (i.e.\ fits). 
In this analysis we have instead chosen to smear the fits to conform to the experimental data. 
The experimental correlation functions therefore remain uncorrected. 
As our corrections are employed at the time of fitting, we'll discuss the full methodology in section \ref{sec:MomResCorrectFit}.
