I would like to thank Douglass Schumacher, my adviser, for his unending support during my time in the High Energy Density Physics group.  At many times the effort to get satisfactory simulations was arduous, and Doug always provided both the kick in the pants and the sound advice I needed to stay on track.  That I am here at all is a testament to his patience and wisdom.

I would like to thank all of my associates in the High Energy Density Physics group at The Ohio State University, both experimentalists and computationalists, who have provided a bevy of sound advice and illuminating conversation during my time here.  Especially, I would like to thank Chris Orban for his important contributions to the simulation code LSP that I used for the majority of my work, and for his generosity sharing the simulation time given to him on the Gordon supercomputer.  I would also like to thank Vladimir Ovchinnikov, Matthew M. McMahon and Sheng Jiang for generously sharing their simulation decks.

Finally, I would like to thank my family, particularly my parents, for their love and support that has allowed me to reach this milestone.  And a hearty thank you to my brother Chuck for his continued support.
