\section{Summary}
Results have been shown for correlation functions $\Lambda\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$ and $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ pairs.  The low- to mid-$k^*$ suppression of the $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ correlations in each of the three centrality bins may indicate pair annihilation processes reminiscent of those reported in other studies.
