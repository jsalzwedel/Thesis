\subsubsection{Analysis code}
The analysis classes used for this study are checked into AliPhysics in the AliPhysics/PWGCF/FEMTOSCOPY/V0LamAnalysis directory, and they have "AliAnalysisV0Lam" prefix.
The AddTask macro used in the analysis train is AliPhysics/PWGCF/FEMTOSCOPY/macros/AddTaskLamLam.C.

\subsubsection{Data selection}
\label{sec:DataSelection}
The most recent analysis was performed on 06 May, 2016 using AliRoot vAN-20160506-1.
The analysis was run using the PWGCF train with dataset LHC11h\_AOD145\_fieldconfigs.
The data were from PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$  TeV taken from the LHC11h (AOD145) pass 2 reconstruction. 
Runs were selected if they were listed with a pass 2 global quality of 1 ("Good run") in the Run Condition Table. 
Approximately 66 million combined central, semi-central and minimum bias events were analyzed. 
The following runs were used, which comprise both the positive (++) and negative magnetic (--) field orientations:

170593, 170572, 170388, 170387, 170315, 170313, 170312, 170311, 170309, 170308, 170306, 170270, 170269, 170268, 170230, 170228, 170207, 170204, 170203, 170193, 170163, 170159, 170155, 170091, 170089, 170088, 170085, 170084, 170083, 170081, 170040, 170027, 169965, 169923, 169859, 169858, 169855, 169846, 169838, 169837, 169835, 169591, 169590, 169588, 169587, 169586, 169557, 169555, 169554, 169553, 169550, 169515, 169512, 169506, 169504, 169498, 169475, 169420, 169419, 169418, 169417, 169415, 169411, 169238, 169167, 169160, 169156, 169148, 169145, 169144, 169138, 169099, 169094, 169091, 169045, 169044, 169040, 169035, 168992, 168988, 168826, 168777, 168514, 168512, 168511, 168467, 168464, 168460, 168458, 168362, 168361, 168342, 168341, 168325, 168322, 168311, 168310, 168115, 168108, 168107, 168105, 168076, 168069, 167988, 167987, 167985, 167920, 167915

Analysis was also performed on the LHC12a17a\_fix Monte Carlo HIJING run, which corresponds to the ++ field orientation events of the LHC11h anchors.  
Approximately 650 thousand events were analyzed from runs

170593, 170572, 170388, 170387, 170315, 170313, 170312, 170311, 170309, 170308, 170306, 170270, 170269, 170268, 170230, 170228, 170207, 170204, 170203, 170193, 170163, 170159, 170155, 170091, 170089, 170088, 170085, 170084, 170083, 170081, 170040, 170027, 169965, 169923, 169859, 169858, 169855, 169846, 169838, 169837, 169835

In all cases, the z-position of the primary vertex was required to be within 10 cm of the center of the ALICE detector for an event to be selected.  

\subsubsection{Centrality Flattening}
\label{sec:CentralityFlattening}

Each event is characterized by a centrality percent.
There are 100 centrality bins ranging from 0\%  (head-on collisions) to 99\% (glancing collisions), and the centrality percent is defined such that each bin would be sampled equally using a minimum bias trigger.
The LHC11h dataset employed central and semi-central triggers in addition to the minimum bias trigger, so the centrality bins are not equally filled.
There are approximately as many events in the 0-10\% range as there are in the 10-50\% range.

While the events in the 10-50\% show an even sampling, the number of events in each of the 0-10\% centrality bins differ by a few percent.
This analysis uses a technique called centrality flattening to ensure that each of the 0-10\% bins are sampled evenly.
For each magnetic field configuration, each centrality bin is assigned a weight that brings that bin even with the bin with the smallest overall content (the 9\% bin).
We use those weights and a random number generator to determine whether or not to throw away any given event.

The centrality flattening code can be found in AliAnalysisV0Lam::RejectEventCentFlat().


\subsubsection{Detector use}
Both the data analysis as well as the MC analysis utilized information from several different detectors.  
Event centrality was measured using the V0 detector with a timing cut from the Zero Degree Calorimeter.  
The Inner Tracking System (ITS), Time Projection Chamber (TPC), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD), and Time of Flight detector together provided global tracking for the daughter particles.  
Particle identification (PID) was performed using the TPC, as well as using the Time of Flight detector (TOF) when possible.
