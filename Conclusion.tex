% List results, and include some interpretation (QS, annihilation)

Results have been shown for correlation functions of $\Lambda\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$ and $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ pairs.  
The low- to mid-$k^*$ suppression of the $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ correlations in each of the three centrality bins may indicate pair annihilation processes reminiscent of those reported in other studies.

This approach may have applicability for measuring the poorly known interactions of other pairs, such as $\Lambda\Xi^-$, $\Lambda K^-$ and $\Lambda K^+$, or $Xi^-K^-$ and $Xi^-K+$.
The $\Lambda K^\pm$ and $\Xi^-K^\pm$ results in particular may be interesting; the kaon charge conjugation may reveal differences in inelastic interactions between pairs containing $s$ and $\bar{s}$ quarks, versus pairs that contain $u$ and $\bar{u}$ quarks or no corresponding quark-antiquark particles at all.

% Joint fitting between pp, pL, LL (and similarly for the corresponding particle-antiparticle pairs) can increase the precision of radius and scattering lengths for these pairs, and it may provide enough constraints to measure the scattering lengths of the residual pairs such as $\Lambda$\Sigma^0$.
