\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

In this thesis, we presented centrality-dependent femtoscopy of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ baryons measured in $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions by the ALICE collaboration at the LHC.
This is the first measurement of $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ femtoscopy, and the first measurement of $\Lambda\Lambda\oplus\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$ to account for residual correlations using the same analytic framework that is employed for the primary correlation.

Using Monte Carlo HIJING events with ALICE reconstruction effects, we estimated the number of pairs where a $\Lambda$ came from a $\Sigma$, $\Xi^-$, $\Xi^0$, $\Omega$, or false reconstruction, and we found that only 25\% of pairs have two primary $\Lambda$ and/or $\bar{\Lambda}$.
The rest have at least one secondary $\Lambda$, and the physics describing the contribution of those pairs to the correlation function depends on the interactions between the parent particles.
We estimated their correlation function contributions using the same analytic framework used to calculate the primary $\Lambda\Lambda\oplus\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$ and $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ correlation functions.
In that calculation, we assumed that the parent pairs interacted with the same strength and femtoscopic radius as primary pairs, then we smeared out the relative momentum dependence according to the parent-to-$\Lambda$ decay kinematics.
We used the combined femtoscopic contribution of each  pair type to fit the measured correlation functions.
In this way, we were able to turn the heavier hyperons' signal contamination into additional statistical power.

Our correlation function model follows the analytic framework laid out by Lednicky and Lyuboshits.
It utilizes a one-dimensional Gaussian parametrizaton  for the two-particle emission function that describes the relative separation of emission points.
The particle interactions are accounted for with an s-wave scattering parameterization of the two-particle wave function, including antisymmetrization for the $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$ pairs.
For s-wave scattering, we use the asymptotic form of an incoming plane wave and an outgoing spherical wave, where the scattering amplitude depends on the scattering length $f_0$ and the effective range of interaction $d_0$.
When fitting, we constrained the same scattering parameters across each centrality bin to improve the precision of the measurement.

In this analysis, we extracted femtoscopic radii for three centralities of $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ and two centralities of $\Lambda\Lambda\oplus\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$.
Hydrodynamic calculations suggest that there should be a rough scaling of the radii with the inverse of the transverse mass of the particles.
The radii we have measured serve to complement other femtoscopic analyses by providing measurements at large transverse mass $m_\mathrm{T}$.
For $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$, we measured $R_{\Lambda\bar{\Lambda},0-10\%} = 2.9\pm 0.3 \pm 0.3$ fm, $R_{\Lambda\bar{\Lambda},10-30\%} = 2.3\pm 0.2 \pm 0.2$ fm, and $R_{\Lambda\bar{\Lambda},30-50\%} = 1.8\pm 0.2 \pm 0.2$ fm. 
While these points do follow the trend set by pions, kaons, and protons, the $\Lambda\Lambda\oplus\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$ break this scaling dramatically.
Here we measured $R_{\Lambda\Lambda\oplus\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}, 0-10\%} = 5.4 \pm 0.6 \pm 0.2$ fm and  $R_{\Lambda\Lambda\oplus\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}, 10-30\%} = 4.2 \pm 0.5 \pm 0.2$ fm.
We did not have sufficient statistics to fit the 30-50\% centrality bin.
These $\Lambda\Lambda\oplus\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$ radii are nearly double their $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ counterparts.
It is unclear at this time what physics effects might lead to this separation.
Pair creation might lead to $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ radii being smaller than $\Lambda\Lambda\oplus\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$ radii, but would not account for $\Lambda\Lambda\oplus\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$ radii deviating significantly from the $m_\mathrm{T}$ trends.
Another possibility is that the $\Lambda\Lambda\oplus\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$ correlation function, which only extends through a few $k^*$ bins, might be corrupted by under or overcompensated detector effects.

We measured the scattering parameters of these systems.
$\Re f_{0,\Lambda\Lambda\oplus\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}} = -0.6 \pm 0.3 \pm 0.05$ fm, which is within the systematic errors of STAR's measurement.
This interaction is small, about an order of magnitude smaller than the deuteron bound state, which supports claims that $\Lambda\Lambda$ has no dibaryon bound state.
The effect of the nuclear final state interactions on the $\Lambda\Lambda$ pair appears to be small compared to the contribution from Fermi-Dirac suppression.
The scattering length measured by femtoscopy experiments is approximately the same magnitude as the estimate arising from hypernuclear structure experiments, but they are opposite in sign.
It is unclear how to rectify these differences at this time.
The real part of the scattering lengths of $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ and $\Lambda\Lambda\oplus\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$ are comparable in size ($\Re f_{0,\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}} = -0.5 \pm 0.1 \pm 0.1$ fm), suggesting that the elastic interactions of these hyperons behave the same.

The imaginary part of the scattering length $\Im f_0$ accounts for the inelastic process of annihilation.
As a baryon-baryon pair, $\Lambda\Lambda\oplus\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$ has no imaginary component to its scattering length, but we have measured it for $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$.
Here, $\Im f_{0,\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}} = 0.14 \pm 0.09 \pm 0.2$ fm.
This is considerably smaller than the measured values for p$\mathrm{p}$ and p$\bar{\Lambda}$, both of which appear to fall around 0.8 fm.

The effective range of interaction $d_0$ is a correction to the scattering amplitude, and its effect on the correlation function is small compared to that of the scattering length.
Given that and the small FSI seen in $\Lambda\Lambda\oplus\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$, it is not surprising that $d_0$ is not particularly well constrained for $\Lambda\Lambda\oplus\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$, with $d_{0,\Lambda\Lambda\oplus\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}} = 5.3 \pm 2.7 \pm 0.3$ fm.
The $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ FSI effects extend to a much larger $k^*$ range, so we have better resolving power for the effective range $d_{0,\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}} = 1.7 \pm 0.2 \pm 0.2$ fm.

The Pb-Pb data taken in the second run of the LHC will afford another chance to look at these phenomena.



%Results have been shown for correlation functions of $\Lambda\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$ and $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ pairs.  
%The low- to mid-$k^*$ suppression of the $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ correlations in each of the three centrality bins may indicate pair annihilation processes reminiscent of those reported in other studies.

This approach may have applicability for measuring the poorly known interactions of other pairs, such as $\Lambda\Xi^-$, $\Lambda K^-$ and $\Lambda K^+$, or $Xi^-K^-$ and $Xi^-K+$.
The $\Lambda K^\pm$ and $\Xi^-K^\pm$ results in particular may be interesting; the kaon charge conjugation may reveal differences in inelastic interactions between pairs containing $s$ and $\bar{s}$ quarks, versus pairs that contain $u$ and $\bar{u}$ quarks or no corresponding quark-antiquark particles at all.

% Joint fitting between pp, pL, LL (and similarly for the corresponding particle-antiparticle pairs) can increase the precision of radius and scattering lengths for these pairs, and it may provide enough constraints to measure the scattering lengths of the residual pairs such as $\Lambda$\Sigma^0$.
