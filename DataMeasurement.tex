\chapter{Data measurement}
\label{sec:DataMeasurement}

In this chapter, we discuss the experimental details involved in measuring $\Lambda$ correlations.
Section \ref{sec:GeneralDetails} covers minutiae about the data sets used in this analysis, the event selection criteria, the relevant subsystems of the ALICE detector, and the code used to perform the analysis.
We describe the process of reconstructing $\Lambda$, including the cuts employed to reduce contamination from secondary or fake $\Lambda$, in Section \ref{sec:ParticleSelection}.
Section \ref{sec:CorrelationFunctionConstruction} details how correlation functions are constructed.
Finally, Section \ref{sec:SysUncertaintyCF} contains a study of the systematic uncertainties on the correlation functions, and plots of the correlation functions with error bars can be found in Section \ref{sec:CorrelationFunctionResults}.
